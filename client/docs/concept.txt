Simul is open web-platform for making webinars.

Like in many modern's software there is no security - it's fully your concern to make your webinar secure.
This maybe not very good for "Serious Business", but it should fit for making any OpenSource webinars.

Planned Features for 0.1 Version:

- Any number of "rooms" via specific URL hashpart
- Sound broadcasting from and to browser (no additional software required)
- PDF casting (JS)
- Two user role levels via room's security key (any user who know seckey can "promote" self to lector)
- Only one simultaneous lector
- Chat free-for-all
- User list with description

Technical features
- Jquery & Jquery UI
- w2ui for layouts
- Recorderjs for audio capturing from lectors
- ices + icecast2 (currently considering other options too) for audio transport
- HTML5 for audio playback from remote stream source (muses.org)
- pdf.js for displaying slides
- some chat solution
- small standardised requirements for backend
- Java-based sample backend

Workflow
- page loads
- from URL hash we got roomID (if it's not there - ask user to either enter it, or get right link somewhere),
    so we can build ajax URL
- connect to webinar room, get room state
- periodically poll events, handle them
